# Python-Basic-Analysis-Project

Hi, I'm **Roshini Rangani**, Studying Masters in Data Analytics, in USA ,As very passionate about data one day when i wokeup i got idea to showcase my journey to become a data analyst,so here i'm so started working on python and i build this little guide for people like me!
When I started this project, I had **very basic knowledge of Python**.  
I created this project mainly for people like me â€” those who are **beginners** but want to **become Data Analysts**.

If you are just starting your Python journey, this project will really help you understand:
- How Python is used in real-world data analysis
- How to clean, analyze, and visualize business data
- How to create simple dashboards and forecasts

##  Project Overview

In this project, I explored **Sales Data** from a superstore business.

Hereâ€™s what I did:
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created beautiful **bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps**
- Built a **Sales Forecasting Model** to predict future sales
- Created an **Interactive Dashboard** using Plotly to summarize key insights
---
## Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name:** Sample Superstore Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Public Dataset
- **Description:** This dataset includes customer orders, sales, profits, discounts, shipping details, and regional information.
- **Size:** 10,000+ records
---
## Key Findings

- The **Consumer segment** brought in the highest sales and profits, making it the most valuable group for the business.
- The **Corporate segment** showed moderate performance in both sales and profit.
- The **Home Office segment** contributed the least, highlighting opportunities for better engagement or marketing efforts.

## Visualizations and Dashboard

Since GitHub and LinkedIn don't directly support interactive Plotly dashboards,  
I have shared a screenshot of the dashboard below for easy viewing:

## ðŸ› Skills Used
- Python Programming
- Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Plotly for interactive dashboards
- Statsmodels for forecasting
- Scikit-learn for basic predictive modeling
---
## Conclusion
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Work with real-world messy datasets
- Apply different types of data analysis techniques
- Build simple predictive models
- Create professional dashboards

If you are starting your data analytics journey,  
I hope this project gives you a **clear learning path** just like it did for me! ðŸŒŸ
